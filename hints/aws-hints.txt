@Massimo Balestri: the following will be documented üòä

All,

The long-awaited EKS cluster is finally here, I am delighted to deliver the beast today after a considerable labour, thanks for your forbearance.

It‚Äôs already pre-confirmed with the following :

1-	Kafka : https://cmak.abxinternal.com/
2-	Schema Registry: https://sr.abxinternal.com
3-	Docker Registry: registry.abxinternal.com
4-	PGO cluster: https://pgcadmin.abxinternal.com
5-	Vault: https://vault.abxinternal.com/ui/vault/auth?with=token
6-	Nexus: https://nexus.abxinternal.com
7-	Monitoring: https://monitoring.abxinternal.com
8-	Nginx ingress controller

You have the full power for the namespaces below :
-	Talbot
-	Grimaldi
-	Archimedes
Docker registry secret (regcred) is already deployed to the mentioned namespaces, so ready to deploy your MS

As you noticed, the domain abxinternal.com is available if you wanted to expose an API endpoint, a sample ingress manifest file can be provided, a demo might be presented if necessary.

How to Login: Since it‚Äôs running on AWS, you need :

1-	Install AWS CLI : Click here for the instructions
2-	Test the CLI: aws version
3-	Configure CLI credentials: aws configure --profile eks-developer
4-	Test Credentials: aws sts get-caller-identity --profile eks-developer
5-	Create your cluster in Lens and copy the kubeconfig file 

Note: if you hit an error in step 4, check your ~/.aws/credentials has the right profile: ‚Äúaws configure list‚Äù  


All necessary credentials are in keeper:

 

Note the AWS user eks-developer has only EKS permissions, cannot login to AWS console. ( don‚Äôt try üòä )
