===============
1. weather:
    1. docker image dutchweather-server:20220113-1129-28 uploaded to harbor
    2. rancher used to edit the deployment for weather-dutchweather-server to use this image
    3. endpoint tested: https://weather-acans.kixs.org/api/dutchweather/v1/DutchWeather/tafs - returns data
    4. logs checked - no fails so "TAF AMD" entries are now successfully processed
    5. the weather container in the docker vm has been stopped
2. discovery:
    1. rancher used to update the configmap value services__services__4__addresses__0 to https://weather-acans.kixs.org (ie, use kubernetes)
    2. updated endpoints to have /api/dutchweather/v1/DutchWeather - KW to check helm charts
3. identity server:
    1. environment variable values were not set for
        IDENTITYSERVER__APISECRET=parameter
        IDENTITYSERVER__APIUSERPASSWORD=parameter
        but were present in the secrets file
        -
        the helm chart needs to be updated to be consistent with the other microservices so:
        a. update to make consistent
        b. test and fix these values as needed.
